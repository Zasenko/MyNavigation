This may seem obvious, but due to the vastness of the country and the four seasons, temperature and weather vary greatly. For the top tourist destinations, Madrid and Barcelona, the spring (April/May) and autumn (October/November) are ideal as itâ€™s not too hot.\n\nIf youâ€™re looking to visit for a specific event, then Three Kings Day in January, Carnival in February, Semana Santa in April and pride during the summer should top your list. Traditionally, Spaniards take their summer holiday for several weeks in August leaving cities like Madrid a ghost town. You can find most locals at their summer homes on the coast as central and southern Spain in the summer months (July/August) are typically quite hot and 100â„‰ (37â„ƒ) days are common.",
